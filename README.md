# Gree Climate WebSocket + REST API

Advanced REST and WebSocket API for controlling Gree air conditioners with real-time state monitoring.

**Note**: This API requires Gree devices configured in local mode. Not all features may be available for all air conditioner models.

**Note**: For now, the application uses custom patches to the `greeclimate` library. The patches are taken from the `greeclimate` repository pull requests.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automatic device discovery** - Scans the network for Gree air conditioners on startup and on demand
- **REST API** - Full RESTful API for device control
- **WebSocket** - Real-time communication with clients
- **State monitoring** - Automatic polling at a specified interval
- **Change notifications** - Instant notifications about state changes via WebSocket
- **Error handling** - Automatic reconnection to devices

### Application Access
- **API**: http://localhost:8123
- **WebSocket**: ws://localhost:8123/ws

## üîå REST API

API documentation is available at: [http://localhost:8123/docs](http://localhost:8123/docs)

## üîå WebSocket API

### Connection
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8123/ws');
```

### Message Types

#### 1. Initial status
Automatically sent after connection:
```json
{
  "type": "list",
  "data": [ /* List of devices, schema exactly the same as for /devices endpoint */ ]
}
```

#### 2. State change (automatic)
Sent to all WebSocket clients when a device state change is detected. The `data` field contains only the changed parameters.
```json
{
  "type": "report",
  "mac": "aabbccddeeff",
  "data": {
    "current_temperature": {
      "old": 22,
      "new": 23
    },
    "current_humidity": {
      "old": 50,
      "new": 55
    }
  },
}
```

#### 3. Updating device state
```javascript
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  "type": "update",
  "mac": "aabbccddeeff",
  "data": {
    "power": true,
    "target_temperature": 22
    /* [...] */
  }
}));
```

You can update single or multiple parameters at once. The `mac` field is the device's MAC address, and the `data` field contains the parameters to update.
If the command had an effect, you will soon receive a `report` message; otherwise, you will receive a `not_changed` message.

#### 7. Errors
```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "message": "Device not found"
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Build and run in docker

### Build the Docker image
```bash
docker build -t gree-ws .
``` 


### Run the Docker container (network mode: host required)
The application uses network broadcasts and must be run with `--network host`.

```bash
docker run -it --name gree-ws --rm --network host gree-ws
```

> **Note:** The `-p` option is not needed with `--network host`.


### Environment variables
The following environment variables can be set to control the application:

- `PORT` ‚Äî Port on which the application will listen (default: 8123)
- `DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT` ‚Äî Device discovery timeout in seconds (default: 3)
- `POLLING_INTERVAL` ‚Äî Device polling interval in seconds (default: 2)
- `VERBOSE` ‚Äî Enable verbose logging (default: false)

Example usage with Docker:
```bash
docker run -it --name gree-ws --rm --network host -e DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT=5 -e POLLING_INTERVAL=5 gree-ws
```

### Run with Docker Compose
You can also use Docker Compose to run the application. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  gree-ws:
    build: .
    network_mode: host
    environment:
      - PORT=8123
      - DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT=5
      - POLLING_INTERVAL=1
```
